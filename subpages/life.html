          <h4>Mary Shelley's Early Life</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">10 days. Mary Shelley’s mother only spent 10 days of life with her, leaving the burden of child care to her father William Godwin.</p>
		<p class="left-align light">Born on August 30, 1797, in Somers town England, Shelley’s intellectual father would support her for the first 4 years of life. However, Shelley would begin dealing with hardships in 1801 when her father married Mary Jane Clairmont. Shelley and her step mother did not get along and she prioritized her own children over Shelley. She even thought it was not necessary for Shelley to get an education. Nonetheless, Godwin's extensive library gave her an endless amount of ammunition to train her reading skills. Many skilled and literate people such as Aaron Burr and Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to Godwin’s household; the young admiration she had for them also sparked her intellectual voyage.</p>

          <h4>Romances</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Shelley’s romantic relationships were anything but normal. From suicide to premature child deaths, Shelley has been through a melting pot of destruction. </p>
		<p class="left-align light">Godwin’s prestigious carrier as a writer and philosopher attracted many young aspiring writers including Percy Bysshe - a well educated made from Eton and Oxford university and soon to be husband with Mary Shelley. Shelley met Percy around 1814, returning from Scotland. Percy frequently visited Godwin’s household, and over time fell in love with Shelley. Percy was a married man before falling in love with Shelley, but he got dissatisfied with his marriage. However, marriage approval did not come easy for Godwin’s because of Shelley’s poor financial situation. As a result, Percy and Shelley moved to France to liberate themselves from Godwin’s stern rule over their lives. Marking the next step in life, Shelley began writing poems and gave birth to 4 children - 3 of which died. </p>

          <h4>Writing Career</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Mary Shelley’s first book gave the audience of glimps of Europe from her journey with Percy. Letters about her time in France became the foundation for History of a Six Weeks' Tour through a part of France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland, with Letters descriptive of a Sail round the Lake of Geneva, and of the Glaciers of Chamouni, written in 1817. As a foreigner to France, she captures the spirit of excitement and adventure.</p>
		  <p class="left-align light">One of Shelley’s most notable book is Frankenstein, written in 1818. Inspired by the death of her first child, Shelley had a dream that the child came back to life. This staged the major plot of an artificial human form coming to life. Although she began writing Frankenstein in France she finished it in England. Unfortunately, being the son of Godwin and married to Percy made people think her literary works were written by Percy. </p>
			<p class="left-align light">After Frankenstein was published, other literary works she published were Mathilda, Valperga, and The Last Man.</p>
